# when adding a new file, add it to the list of files to be updated
# and leave the md5 value empty. Then execute the calcmd5.py script
# to calculate the md5 sum of all files and update them in the config
# add the like this
# files:
#   - path: ./path/to/file
#   - md5: <----Leave this empty!

# config.yaml doesn't need to go here! It has its own versioning and
# uses a special function to not lose data in case of an update

# all paths are relative to calcmd5.py !!!! it will not work it's anywhere else
# ./ means the root folder of the repo
